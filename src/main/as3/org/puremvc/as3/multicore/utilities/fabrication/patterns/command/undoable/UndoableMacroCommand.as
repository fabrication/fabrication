	 * UndoableMacroCommand is the undoable fabrication command for grouping

	 * will be undone in the reverse order that they were initially executed.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * To add sub commands to the macro command use the addSubCommand method.
	 * Subcommands must be added only in the initializeUndoableComamnd method.
	 * A super.initializeUndoableCommand must be called first in this method.  
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The addSubCommand method supports associating a notification with the 
	 * sub command. The notification is optional, and if only a body is specified
	 * a notification object is created automatically at the time of execution.
